# The Depths of Europa
by Dennis Sauve

## Premise
You're an astronaut traveling with a team of explorers to Europa. On your way to Europa, disaster strikes and your crew dies. With no other course of action, you alone must complete the mission to Europa, in the hopes of finding the return module left on the surface from a previous supply mission.

## Style
Text based RPG, classically styled. Ruby based now.

## Progress so far
**September 24, 2017**
* Created Scenes 3 + 4
* Decided to make Chapters into modules
* Moving away from text file level interactions, and hardcoding each scene.
* When on the moon Europa, I'm planning on making more of an array map of chunks of land rather than hard coding everything in. This would allow me to make changes to the map on a whim.
* Updated how commands are parsed.
* Not to be forgotten, but on paper have created mapped layout of ship, crew manifest.

**September 18, 2017**
* Created Scene Two
* Moved Array Modification to utils.rb
* Worked out scene 1 - 2 transition idea

**September 17, 2017**
* Created project
* Set up initial program
* Will be taking some time to flesh out the first chapter, probably on pen and paper, and then code some more.
