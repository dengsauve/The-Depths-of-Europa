cockpit - Earth
Launch day. 08:30. Cape Canaveral. You're sitting in the cockpit of the mark 8 shuttle, NASA's first manned spacecraft to journey beyond the asteroid belt. To your left sits Natasha, long time friend and a member of the 5 person exploration crew. In front of you, the radio indicator pulses, signalling that mission control wants to talk to you.
Natasha looks at you, patiently waiting for you to answer Mission Control.
The radio indicator pulses a soft blue on the control panel. Mission control has something to say.
The open fields and hills of cape canaveral are visible through the window to your left. You can see observers off in the distance, eagerly awaiting the launch.
Your helmet prevents you from seeing behind you. It's a chair though.
More controls, indicators, and switches than you know what to do with. Natasha is the primary pilot on this mission.
The legs of your spacesuit are strapped down to the seat.
