general rec - shuttle
You're in the general recreation area. All around you is the day to day living essentials - Workout Equipment, Kitchen, Exploration Gear, and the Science station are all here.
The workout and science station. Treadmills beside centrifuges, the compact design is to accommodate the limited volume of the ship.
The stasis room is ahead of you. You hear the other crew members chatting in there.
The kitchen and gear-up area. Food and adventure, sounds like a hobbit's dream.
The command cabin is behind you. Everything is left on autopilot.
Above you are the shuttle bay doors, designed to open and expand the habitat into a two level facility. Gear and experiments can be setup once the ship lands.
The floor is beneath you. What's your interest in what's below you?
