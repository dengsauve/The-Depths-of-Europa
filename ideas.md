# Interaction
Typing only. No pre-rendered speech options, the players must type what they want to do.

### Commands
* \[ go | move \] \[ left | right | forward | backward | up | down \]
* \[ turn | switch \] \[ on | off \] \[ *object* \]
* \[ open | close \] \[ door | hatch \]


# Immersion
There will be 'Chapters', and every Chapter will have 'Scenes'.

* Chapter: A whole, standalone segment of the story.
* Scene: Where the user is in the 'map'. Much like a cell on a grid.

Players will be able to type 'look' or 'look around' to get a narration of where they are and what is around them.


## Mechanics

I imagine that looking around will be simple enough. There will have to be triggers of course that break the scene, such as turning on the radio.
